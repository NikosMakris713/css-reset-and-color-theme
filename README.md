## The purpose of this repository
While it's true that in the era of modern web development CSS browser compatibility issues are much less likely than they were in the old IE 6 days, Inconsistencies between different browsers do still occure occasionally. In order to make my life as a developer a little bit easier and help me improve the precision and consistency of my projects i decided to create this project.
